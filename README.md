# Christian Haggerty

Hello! My name is Christian Haggerty,

While my path as a developer began a year ago, my life in the world of audio and event production was ripe with opportunities to solve complex technical problems, design / create visual experiences, and empathize with the users of my industry to create the best possible experience.

But after almost a decade,  and the birth of my daughter. A career change was calling me and Iâ€™m so glad I answered! I began self study a year ago and then enrolled in a 6 month full time bootcamp at The Nashville Software School.

Unsurprisingly I found that I had a deep affinity for Front End Development and Design, so upon graduation I found the Google UX Design Certification course which I am currently working on part time.

I am looking for my first professional role as a front end developer / UX Designer and am filled with excitement to see where this road takes me!
