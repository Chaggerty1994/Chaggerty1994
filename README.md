# Christian Haggerty

I am a software developer with a background in audio engineering, event production, and multi-media art / content creation. Throughout my professional career I have used creativity and technical experience to interpret  my clients vision and bring that vision to life. I am passionate about aesthetics and functional design and I have been extremely inspired by the opportunity to combine that passion with my love for technology and intricate problem solving with software development.

I am currently looking for a position as an Entry-Level Software Developer. If you have openings, please reach out.
