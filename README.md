# My Work Highlights

## Black Hoodies 

Black Hoodies is an online store . Designed to be minimilast, accessible, and display a very clear brand identity. My goals in development were to dig deeper into react making conscious use of CSS grid on the front end, and make use of well structured data, custom actions and joins on the backend to minimize the need for alteration of data on my front end.
