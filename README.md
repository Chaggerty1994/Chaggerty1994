# Christian Haggerty

Audio Engineer turned software developer. I have been dedicated to the world of audio and event production for the last decade. As much as I love it, after years of the grind, mainly working nights and weekends. I felt the need to make a shift into a career that can stimulate my creative technical mind and provide more work / life balance. Im excited to adapt my creativity, intricate problem-solving, love of constantly evolving technology, teamwork, and clear communication into the world of software development.

I am currently looking for a position as an Entry-Level Software Developer. If you have openings, please reach out.
